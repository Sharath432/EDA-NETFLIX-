Netflix Basic Data Cleaning Project
Overview
This project focuses on performing basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset using Python in a Google Colab environment. The primary goal is to preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, correct data inconsistencies, and derive meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.
Project Description
The Netflix Basic Data Cleaning Project involves loading a Netflix dataset, identifying and addressing data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types, and performing exploratory analysis to uncover trends and patterns. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, utilizing popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Key Objectives

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats (e.g., date parsing, categorical encoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of key variables, such as movie/TV show genres, release years, and ratings.
Insights: Identify trends in Netflix content, such as popular genres, production countries, or content growth over time.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix titles, including attributes such as:

Title
Type (Movie/TV Show)
Genre
Release Year
Rating
Duration
Country
Description

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository. Users must provide their own Netflix dataset or use a publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) to replicate the analysis.
Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following:

Google Colab or a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook support
Python Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn


A Netflix dataset in CSV format (or similar)

Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/netflix-data-cleaning.git


Open the Google Colab notebook link: Netflix Basic Data Cleaning Notebook
Upload the Netflix dataset to your Google Colab environment or mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
Install the required libraries in the Colab notebook:!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn



Usage

Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
Load the Netflix dataset into the notebook using Pandas.
Follow the step-by-step code in the notebook to:
Clean the dataset (handle missing values, remove duplicates, etc.).
Perform exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualize genre distributions or release year trends).


Modify the code as needed to explore additional aspects of the dataset or apply different cleaning techniques.
